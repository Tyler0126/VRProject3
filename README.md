# VR Project 3 - Temple Builder

## [Link to Video of Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9XWc5V5olU)

## Background:
Our game we are creating is called temple builder. It is a gather/building game implemented In Unity.  The main objective of the game is to collect resources and use these collected resources to upgrade your base. The resources needed for upgrading your base are stone and wood. You spawn with a pickaxe and an axe, and you use these tools to cut down trees and break down boulders found throughout the landscape. The game starts with no buildings in site, and eventually you can upgrade through 3 tiers of changes to have your very own village made by you!

## Objective:
The objective of Temple Builder is to gather materials (wood and stone) to upgrade your village through 3 tiers. Whenever you have the required amount of resources for an upgrade, you will be prompted to visit the town hammer where a simple click will transform you village!

## Controls:
Use WASD to move. SPACE to jump. 1 switches to your pickaxe that is used to mine stone from boulders, and 2 switches to your axe which is used to chop down trees for wood. Press the Esc key to pause the game and access the help menu. 

## Student Duties/Contributions:
Evan: Evan is the one that initially got the project up and running. He imported the nature pack that acts as the environment for the project. Evan also created the scripts that added the rock breaking and gathering functionality, and by going off his script Tyler was able to get the tree gathering functionality to work as well. Evan created the axe and pickaxe animations and functionalities too. He also imported the assets that represent the various buildings in the town. Evan also created the scripts that act as the functionality for upgrading the town and displaying the various tiers of the town based upon how many upgrades have taken place. Evan also contributed to the 

Tyler: Tyler went off Evan's script that implemented the rock breaking and gathering and created the tree chopping and gathering functionality for the game. Tyler also made the UI/HUD for the game. As well as the UI, Tyler made the pause functionality and the help menu for the game. Tyler also created the scripts that had to be made in order to manage the pause menu and help menu of the game. Tyler also added the wells and windmill assets to the town part of the game and linked them to their appropriate scripts to add them to the upgrading functionality and logic. 

Moses: Moses fixed an early issue we had that was messing with some of our character's movements and controls. Moses also added some assets to the game that enhanced the overall look of the game. He also fixed a big issue we were having with our mining and chopping functionalities. Moses contributed to the idea generation of the game greatly as well.

## Description of Application:
Our game was built in the Unity environment. It utilizes several different assets and models which will be discussed below.

## Inspiration:
The main source of inspiration we got from creating this game was from the game Minecraft developed by Mojang. We gathered the most ideas from this game, and we took some core features of minecraft such as gathering materials with an axe and pickaxe and using these materials to build things. Minecraft presented is with these core ideas, and we added our own spins and twists to develop our game.
